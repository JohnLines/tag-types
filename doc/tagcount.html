<title>Tagcount - count things in a tag file</title>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>
	tagcount [-h][-r][-f fieldname][-v fieldname value][-a][tagfile][outputfile]

</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>
tagcount counts the number of records, or fields in a tag file.

<h3>Modifier flags</h3>
<dl>
<dt>-h<dd>Disables normal header processing. If this is not present then
the first record is assumed to be a header, and will not be output
<dt>-r<dd>Count records
<dt>-f fieldname<dd>How often does the given field occur
<dt>-x<dd>Modifier for -f, how often does the field NOT occur
<dt>-v fieldname value<dd>How often does the field occur with a given value
<dt>-a<dd>All - show all the fields which occur in the file, together with
how often they occur.

</dl>

If more than one modifier is specified then the results are output in
the order
<pre>
number of records
number of fields
field display
</pre>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
The -f flag can only be specified once (or more accurately only the last
occurance is used)

<p>
-x and -a are not yet implemented
