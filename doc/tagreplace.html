<title>Tagreplace - replace values within a tagged file</title>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>
	tagreplace [-h][-a][-m [ fieldname op [fieldvalue]]... [-n num]
            [-r [fieldname [fieldvalue]...][-f replacefilename]
            [tagfilename]

</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>


<h3>Modifier flags</h3>
<dl>
<dt>-h<dd>Disables normal header processing. If this is not present then
the first record is assumed to be a header, and will always be output
intact as the new header record.
<dt>-a<dd>The selection and replacement process will operate on ALL matching
records, rather than just the first (which is the default).
<p>Matching just the first is expected to be the most common case where the
selection is done by giving the primary tag of the file to match against.
<dt>-m [fieldname op [fieldvalue]]<dd> gives the condition to match to select
the record(s) for replacement.
<dt>-n num<dd>replace record number num
<dt>-r [fieldname [fieldvalue]]<dd> gives the fields to be replaced using the
command line - the given fields in the selected record(s) will be replaced,
but the others will be unchanged.
<dt>-f replacementfilename<dd>the entire contents of the selected record(s)
will be replaced by the contents of the file, which must be in valid tag
format.
<dt>-d<dd>Print debugging information to stderr

</dl>

<h3>Conditions</h3>
Most condition tests are of the form
<pre>
	fieldname operator value
</pre>
but some do not require the value.  

<h3>Bugs</h3>
The whole thing is not yet implemented
