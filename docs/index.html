<h1>MIME Tag types home page</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

This page contains the information about a  MIME type
for exchanging data between some types of application in such a way that the information
is also useful for people who are not using an application which
understands the new type.
<p>
The format is intended to deal with sending a number of elements where each
element has common attributes - possible applications include 
descriptions of books, financial transactions, recipies etc.
Many of these things are exchanged in tag-like formats already, but all would
benefit from using the same overall structure. Different applications can
use different fields but there are core applications which can operate
on any tagged type.
<p>
Thus we can take advantage of common functions across tagged types, for
example project management systems have topological dependancies on actions
which are very similar to the topological dependancies in a package management
system.
<p>
Whew - that all sounds very complicated, but in fact it is very simple - an
example may help

prefer), and when they were serviced.

We can pass a file in this format to a person, and they will be able to
understand what it means, but it is sufficiently structured to allow us to
write a program which will, for example, calculate the total cost of motoring
over a period of time.
<p>
These programs, and this data format, aim to fill the gap between text markup
systems, which are very flexible, but hard for a program to process, and
things like tab separated fields, or the various speadsheet export formats,
which are easy to process, but a bit too rigid for some cases.
<p>
Thus there is a hierarchy of interchange formats, starting with
text/tab-separated, then text/prs.jlines.tag, then text/xml,
then text/html, then text/plain.
In general it is easy to convert automatically in the direction of text/plain,
but processing by an application is easier in the direction of tab-separated.



<p>
On this site you will find some specifications for the tag format, and some
programs which manipulate it.



<p>
The current software version is 0.0.9
