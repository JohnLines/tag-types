MIME media type name: text

MIME subtype name: prs.lines.tag

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: 7bit.

Security considerations:

The openness of the tag format enables a tag message to be checked for
validity easily. Applications which read tag types should check that
the values that they are being presented with are valid.

Overall using tag types should be more secure that passing application
specific data around.

Interoperability considerations: 

The rules for tag type labels are the same as for mail headers.

The application/tag MIME type is intended to convey the type of data
which is usually carried in mail messages in forms such as the MIME type
registration form, but in a more structured manner. As an example the
preceding registration template is repeated at
http://johnlines.github.io/tag-types/mimetype-registration.tag in the
form of a series of tags. The description for the mimetype tag format
can be found at http://johnlines.github.io/tag-types/tag-types/dsc/mimetypes.dsc
and the format of the mimetypes.dsc file is described in
http://johnlines.github.io/tag-types/dsc/dsc.dsc
