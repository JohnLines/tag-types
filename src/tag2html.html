<title>Tag2html - convert a tag file to html</title>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>
	tag2html [-h] [-H] [-t tagname1 tagname2 ...][-l literal ...]
		[-u tagname3]

</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>
tag2html takes in a tag file on stdin and produces html on stdout.
By default it produces output as a series of definition lists, one for
each record. It can also produce a table format.

<h3>Modifier flags</h3>
<dl>
<dt>-h<dd>Disables normal header processing. If this is not present then
the first record is assumed to be a header, and will not be output
<dt>-t tagname1 ...<dd>Produce an html table, using the tagnames given as
the columns, with their values in successive tag records as the data in
the table rows
<dt>-l literal <dd>Implies table mode. Writes a literal value in that table column.
 The dollar sign ($) is a special character, with the following meanings
<ul>
<li>$n - insert the current record number
<li>$v<em>fieldname</em>: - insert the value of that field
<li>$$ - insert a dollar sign
</ul>
<dt>-u tagname...<dd>The value of the field is assumed to be a valid URL
and is written out as an active link. Works in table or list mode.
<dt>-T t_header1 ...<dd>Label the table columns with the headers given,
rather than the default of using the tag labels - only useful in table mode
<dt>-o options<dd>Insert the options text into the html TABLE tag


</dl>

<h3>Notes</h3>
The literal field value can be useful when calling tag2html from a cgi script,
in order to pass control back to the script, for example
<pre>
-l '&lt;a href=/cgi-bin/scriptname/someaction/$vPrimary:&gt;'
</pre>
This could be used for a script called <em>scriptname</em> acting on a tag
file with a primary field called <em>Primary</em> - the whole string from
the dollar sign to the colon is replaced by the value of that field.
