<h1>Tag related programs</h1>


The tag programs are rather like the Rand Mail Handler (MH) in being a
set of tools to manipulate the data - they are a construction set for
building applications rather than an application in their own right.

<dl>

<dt>tagdiff<dd>
	gives the difference between 2 tag files - can take advantage of
	understanding the structure to synchronise better than normal diff.

<dt>tagedit<dd>
	Edit a tag file

<dt><a href=tag2html.html>tag2html</a><dd>
	turn a tag file into html

<dt>tagcheck<dd>
	take in a tag file and a tag descriptor file and check the tag file
	tagcheck -f could fix some problems, for example missing end tags.

<dt>tagdscgen<dd>
	generate a descriptor file from a tag file (really just a fancy
	output of all the different tags found - it should be able to
	work out which is the primary tag)

<dt>tagsort<dd>
	sort a tag file, outputting the records in an order determined by
	the value of some of the tags

<dt><a href=tagreplace.html>tagreplace</a><dd>
	replace the contents of a tag record with values taken from the
	command line, or a file

<dt><a href=tagextract.html>tagextract</a><dd>
	output a subset of records from a tag file e.g.
		tagextract -m Priority -le 6 < actions.dat

<dt>tagshow<dd>
	Display selected fields from a tag file, e.g.
		tagshow	Title,Priority "%s:%s\n"
	will show the Title and Priority fields from a tag file
	The default if no format string is given is just to show a
	single field per line

<dt>tagdispatch<dd>
	takes a tag file as input and pass it on to another program
	depending on what type it is. The intention is that this can be
	used as a target by, for example metamail, and it will in turn
	invoke a different program for a recipie tag file from an
	actions file.
<dt>tag2tab<dd>
	Convert a tag file into a tag seperated file.
<dt>tab2tag<dd>
	Convert a tab seperated file into a tag file
<dt><a href=tagcount.html>tagcount</a><dd>Count things in a tag file

</dl>
